# Product: [Product Name]
Version: 0.1 | Status: DRAFT | Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Problem
What situation exists that this product addresses?
Who experiences it, and what does it cost them (time, money, frustration)?
One focused paragraph. No solution language here.

## 2. Personas
For each user type:
  Name: [role label, not a fictional name]
  Goal: [what they are trying to accomplish]
  Context: [environment, constraints, technical level]
  Success looks like: [observable outcome]

## 3. Core Use Cases
Numbered list. Each is a complete job the product does for a persona.
Format: As a [persona], I need to [action] so that [outcome].
These are not features — they are user goals. Features serve these.

## 4. Business Constraints
Timeline, budget, compliance requirements, geographic restrictions,
regulatory environment. Anything external that bounds what can be built.
If none, write "None known." — do not leave blank.

## 5. Technical Constraints
Existing systems to integrate with, mandated tech stack choices,
infrastructure limitations, team skills, performance non-negotiables.
If none, write "None known."

## 6. Success Metrics
How will you know the product is working?
Measurable, not aspirational. "Users are happy" is not a metric.
"70% of users complete onboarding without support contact" is.

## 7. Out of Scope
Explicit list of things this product deliberately does not do.
This section is as important as what it does — it prevents scope creep
in every feature spec that references this document.

## 8. Open Questions
Unresolved strategic or technical questions that affect product direction.
Format: Q1: [question] | Owner: [person] | Due: [date]
An empty section here means the product definition is stable.
Feature specs should not be written against a product.md with open questions.
