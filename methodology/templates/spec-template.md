# Spec: [Feature Name]
Version: 0.1 | Status: DRAFT | Author: [name] | Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Goal
One sentence. What problem does this solve and for whom?

## 2. Actors
List every user type and system actor that interacts with this feature.

## 3. User Journeys
Format: Given [context] / When [action] / Then [observable outcome]
Write one GWT block per distinct journey. Include the unhappy paths.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
Numbered list. Each criterion must be:
  - independently testable (no "and" in a single criterion)
  - falsifiable (a test can definitively pass or fail it)
  - free of implementation detail

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance, security, accessibility, scalability — specific and measurable.
"Fast" is not a valid NFR. "p95 response < 200ms under 1000 concurrent users" is.

## 6. Out of Scope
Explicit list of what this spec does NOT cover. This prevents scope creep in planning.

## 7. Open Questions
Unresolved ambiguities. Every item here BLOCKS the spec from entering Gate 1.
