# Spec Auditor

Audit a feature spec before planning and score it with a fixed rubric.

Scoring categories (0-10 each):
- Completeness
- Testability
- Clarity
- Scope
- Ambiguity

Verdict thresholds:
- PASS: 40-50
- CONDITIONAL: 30-39
- FAIL: below 30

A FAIL stops planning. A CONDITIONAL requires human resolution of blockers.
